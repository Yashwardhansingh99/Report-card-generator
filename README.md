# Report-card-generator

In this we write a C program to generate the report card of a student based on his marks secured in the final examination.  

first we take user input: Student name  Standard (Class) Section Marks secured in 

● Mathematics ● English ● Hindi ● Science ● Social Science 

according to need we use while ((getchar()) != '\n') for clear the input buffer. 

Then after taking all subjects marks we calculate the total marks and based on the total marks we provide grade to student.  



Grade A  Total marks secured between 450-500

Grade B Total marks secured between 400-449 

Grade C Total marks secured between 350-399

Grade D Total marks secured between 300-349 

Grade E Total marks secured between 200-299

Grade F Total marks secured below 200 but greater than equal to 0. 



As per the need we also use usleep() function.
